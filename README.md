python
======
This part will record my script during my study of python.

And I will save some scripts here.


 | Pattern | Description |
 |:-------:| ----------- |
 | [3-tier](3-tier.py) | data<->business logic<->presentation separation (strict relationships) |
 | [abstract_factory](abstract_factory.py) | use a generic function with specific factories |
 | [adapter](adapter.py) | adapt one interface to another using a whitelist |
 | [borg](borg.py) | a singleton with shared-state among instances |
 | [bridge](bridge.py) | a client-provider middleman to soften interface changes |
 | [builder](builder.py) | call many little discrete methods rather than having a huge number of constructor parameters |
 | [catalog](catalog.py) | general methods will call different specialized methods based on construction parameter |
 | [chain](chain.py) | apply a chain of successive handlers to try and process the data |
 | [command](command.py) | bundle a command and arguments to call later |
 | [composite](composite.py) | encapsulate and provide access to a number of different objects |
 | [decorator](decorator.py) | wrap functionality with other functionality in order to affect outputs |
 | [facade](facade.py) | use one class as an API to a number of others |
 | [factory_method](factory_method.py) | delegate a specialized function/method to create instances |
 | [flyweight](flyweight.py) | transparently reuse existing instances of objects with similar/identical state |
 | [graph_search](graph_search.py) | (graphing algorithms, not design patterns) |
 | [iterator](iterator.py) | structure repeated, identical calls as a generator |
 | [mediator](mediator.py) | an object that knows how to connect other objects and act as a proxy |
 | [memento](memento.py) | generate an opaque token that can be used to go back to a previous state |
